# Research

Our overarching goal is to explore medical images

Here are some themes and techniques that we currently work on:



**Statistical Learning.** Medical image analysis provides a challenge for conventional machine learning approaches due to the nature of the imaging and pathologies involved. The project aims at exploring how to better exploit statistical learning for medical image analysis.

**Spectral Shape Analysis.** The study of complex anatomical structures requires a precise alignment of images (i.e., with a good overlap, structures in images can be compared). This alignment is, however, challenging when very large deformations exist. Instead, structures are studied using shape representations, or so called spectral signatures, that are invariant to external deformations. For example, deformed shapes have curiously similar representations in the spectral domain. Spectral signatures and representations are my current focus of research.

**Accurate Surface Matching**. The analysis of surfaces is important in many fields, particularly in neuroscience where accuracy is critical. Spectral graph theory provides elegant solutions to the problem of surface matching.


**Atlas Construction.** Statistical atlases contain information on the average structure of organs as well as their variabilities. Their constructions require the development of shape averaging tools as well as accurate image registrations.
